<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Highly inspired by the creative aspect of Web Developing, I recently graduated from an online program with Web Development Bootcamp 2024 on Udemy. I am mainly focused on frontend but I also acquired some skills in backend development with Node.js and postgreSQL. I also do study Japanese every day to work in Japan. I can speak English and Korean as well.
